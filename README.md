> The "Download Video" feature (which would render a custom video invitation using Remotion Lambda and AWS) is **currently not available** due to issues with AWS Lambda deployment and configuration.

## Known Issues

- **Video Rendering/Download:**  
  Rendering and downloading a custom video invitation is not available due to AWS Lambda issues.  

- **Remotion Lambda:**  
  If you wish to enable this in the future, ensure your AWS credentials and Lambda setup are correct, and redeploy using `node deploy.mjs`.
